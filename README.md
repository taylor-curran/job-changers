# job-changers

This project is designed to investigate the factors that can predict whether or not a person will work for a certain tech company, through a model that uses the current credentials/demographics/experience of a person to predict the probability that this person is a candidate who is looking for a new job or who would be willing to work for the company.

### To Use:
Install the libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Future work:
- Tweeking model hyperparameters to improve ensemble model performance.
- Improve model interpretability using SHAP values and Partial dependence plots.
